## Getting started

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) can automatically generate and serve the website for you.
Let's say you have a username/organisation `my-org` and project `my-proj`; if you locate Jekyll source under `docs` folder of master branch in your repo `github.com/my-org/my-proj`, the website will be served on `my-org.github.io/my-proj`.
The good thing about coupling your documentation with the source repo is, whenever you merge features with regarding content to master branch, it will also be published in the webpage instantly.

1. Just download the source from [github.com/aksakalli/jekyll-doc-theme](https://github.com/aksakalli/jekyll-doc-theme/master) into your repo under `docs` folder.
2. Edit site settings in  `_config.yml` file according to your project.
3. Replace `favicon.ico` and `img/logonav.png` with your own logo.
