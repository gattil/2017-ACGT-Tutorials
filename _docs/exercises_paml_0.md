**The simple codon model with constant  $$\omega$$** . Choose a dataset from publication 1 and fit model M0 - the most simple codon model with constant $$\omega$$ over time and sites. Run model M0 twice: first with branch lengths fixed to those in the tree file, and once with branch lengths estimated by ML.
Compare the optimised log-likelihoods for the two runs? In which case is it higher? Why?
Next, study the output file for the run with estimated branch lengths:
Do you observe the codon frequency bias?
Study the statistics of nucleotide usage for different codon positions. Which position displays the most bias? Why?
What is the ML estimate of the transition-transversion ratio $$\kappa$$? What is the ML estimate of the $$\omega$$-ratio? How do you interpret these ML estimates?
