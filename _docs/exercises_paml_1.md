Branch models. Use the small lysozyme example (publications 2 and 3) to fit free-ratio model for branches.
Are results consistent with those presented in ref. (2)?
Label the branch leading to colobine clade and fit the 2-ratio branch model to your data.
In addition, label the branch leading to hominoids clade (use different label) and fit the 3-ratio branch model to your data.
Based on LRTs, what model fits your data the best (among 2-ratio, 3-ratio and free-ratio models)?
What are the degrees of freedoms for each comparison?
What can you tell about the evolution of your gene from the ML estimates under this best model?
